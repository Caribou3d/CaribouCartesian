# Caribou-MK3(s) Rel. 3.0

![Caribou-MK3 Rel. 3.0](img/Caribou-MK3-web.png)


## Introduction

Welcome to the Caribou github project page!

Caribou 320 and Caribou 220 are available as a full build or as a kit. You can also mod your Original Prusa printers to Caribou 320 and Caribou 220 with upgrade kits. Numbers are indicating the Z-Axis height. They are all featuring 3030 Aluminium Extrusions and improved plastic parts for rigidity, accuracy and speed. Both mods are almost identical except the Z-Axis motors and rods. You need longer lead screws for 320 build and you can buy identical quality stepper motors from caribou3d.com which have been used on the Original Prusa MK series.


Special thanks to all our members for the contribution as the project is growing within an exceptionally friendly and courteous platform. 🙏

We give references that have influneced the design. Since the majority of plastic parts (even if much improved and somehow "new and different") have their roots in the initial design by Prusa Research we like to mention this a first and most influential reference.
